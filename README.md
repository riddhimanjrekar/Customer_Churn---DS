# Customer_Churn---DS

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a customer will churn (unsubscribe) from an OTT (Over-The-Top) streaming service based on their usage behavior and profile. By identifying churn-prone users, streaming platforms can take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

Models Used
Four classification models were trained and compared:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
